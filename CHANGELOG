2012-07-08 ssl-cipher-suite-enum v0.4

* Added "--outfile file" option to log output to file
* Added options --sslv2 --sslv2 --tlsv1 --tlsv1_1 --tlsv1_2 to test only
  the required SSL protocols
* Added "--file file" option to read targets from a file
* Added "--rate n" option to limit scan speed to n connection/sec
* Prints stats on connections / second
* Output is more greppable
* Identification of cipher suites using weak symmertic encryption
* Identification of cipher suites using null encryption
* Identification of cipher suites not providing forward secrecy
* Identification of cipher suites vulnerable to BEAST attack
* Identification of cipher suites using SSLv2
* Identification of cipher suites anonymous Diffie Hellman key exchange
* Added human-readable summary sections for weaknesses identified
* Bug fix: Servers returning "0x0000" dealt with correctly
* Altered way port number is specified from "ip port" to "ip:port"
* More verbose help message
* Beautified output
* Improved SSLv2 probe
* Identifies preferred cipher suite

2012-07-01 ssl-cipher-suite-enum v0.2

* Lowercased cipher suite (hex) numbers for consistency.
* Check hostname resolves.  Only result it once - not once per TCP connection
* Print out resolved IP address
* Change order that protocols are tested in: SSLv2 -> TLSv1.2
* Prints total number of supported cipher suites for each proto
* Print runtime, end time
* 4 x speedup by grouping unpopular cipher suites into a single client hello
